# VR_final_project - Unity game multi-user development and the Photon to manage user and object state.
This project is a part of my master's course - Virtual Reality. The game (whack a mole machine) has two players, a timer, and a score for each player. As the play begins, two players enter a room where there is a Whack a Mole machine, name, and score fields to the left and right. When one of the players, starts the game, the timer starts, and players can see moles coming out of the machine. The player needs to hit a mole in order to score.  As the timer ends, each player's final score is displayed (along with the option to start a new game)to see who won the game.
